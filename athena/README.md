# Athena

> Part of the **[L.ai](https://github.com/nutypebuddha/lai)** umbrella — *verify, don't trust.*

**Relational intelligence — formulas, not facts.**

Athena is a deterministic cross-domain reasoning engine in the L.ai family. It stores no static
facts — instead, it encodes the *relational machinery* that connects concepts across domains.
Given a question, Athena traverses its symbolic graph of formulas to find, compose, and validate
reasoning chains.

Born from CID — whose Tanto engine handles single-domain math verification — Athena is the released form: *Bankai*.

---

## Core Concept

Most knowledge systems store facts: `c = 299,792,458 m/s`. LLMs already have those facts. Athena
stores *formulas* — the relationships *between* facts:

- `mass * acceleration -> force` (Taurus/Physics)
- `force = mass * velocity / time -> momentum` (Aries/Math)
- `momentum -> kinetic_energy` (Aries -> Taurus, Bridging)

The 12 zodiac wheel nodes form a symbolic graph. Formulas live at the nodes, and traversing the
wheel's edges produces *chains* of reasoning across domains. The value is in the chain, not in any
single node.

---

## Architecture

Athena has a **4-layer** architecture inspired by the Bleach concept of ascending power levels:

### Layer Descriptions

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Asauchi** | Public CLI entry point (info, validate, ping). The nameless blade. |
| 2 | **Zanpakuto** | Identity management, authentication, and access tier control (Shikai/Bankai). |
| 3 | **Shikai** | Natural language query parser — extracts intent (evaluate, info, search, traverse, validate), domains, formula IDs, and argument values from raw input. |
| 4 | **Bankai** | The core reasoning engine — evaluates formulas, chains them sequentially, composes cross-domain bridges, traverses the wheel, and solves complete queries. |

---

## Formula Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Traversal Depth | Example |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Atomic** | Single domain | 0 hops | `F = ma` (Taurus / Physics) |
| **Bridging** | 2 domains | 1 hop | `momentum -> kinetic_energy` (Aries -> Taurus) |
| **Vortex** | 4+ domains in a spiral | 3+ hops | Philosophy -> Language -> CS -> Math -> Psychology |

---

## The Zodiac Wheel

The 12 domains are arranged as a symbolic wheel. Signs are *nominal labels* for domain archetypes,
not literal astrological positions. Relationships between domains are defined by their *aspect*:

| Node | Domain | Symbol |
|------|--------|--------|
| Aries | Math & Logic | ARI |
| Taurus | Physics & Chemistry | TAU |
| Gemini | Astronomy & Cosmology | GEM |
| Cancer | Earth & Environment | CAN |
| Leo | Biology & Medicine | LEO |
| Virgo | Economics & Finance | VIR |
| Libra | Engineering & Tech | LIB |
| Scorpio | Computer Science & AI | SCO |
| Sagittarius | History & Anthropology | SAG |
| Capricorn | Language & Linguistics | CAP |
| Aquarius | Philosophy & Ethics | AQU |
| Pisces | Psychology & Neuroscience | PIS |

Aspects (edge types): **Conjunction** (self), **Sextile** (adjacent, 1 step), **Trine** (harmonious, 4 steps),
**Square** (tension, 3 steps), **Opposition** (complementary, 6 steps).

## Entity Knowledge Graph

Athena's entity system grounds the abstract zodiac wheel in concrete referents. Each entity
is a named thing placed on a domain with its own numeric properties.

### Entity File (TOML)

```toml
# entities/pisces.toml
[[entity]]
id = "major_depression"
name = "Major Depressive Disorder"
domain = "pisces"
description = "DSM-5 diagnosis: persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, cognitive impairment"
tags = ["psychiatry", "mood", "depression", "DSM-5"]
properties = { mood_instability = 0.4, valence = -0.8, arousal = 0.2, affective_intensity = 0.6 }
```

### Entity Resolution in Shikai

When a query mentions an entity name, Shikai automatically:

1. **Resolves the entity** by matching words against the entity registry
2. **Sets the query domain** to the entity's domain (if no domain explicitly given)
3. **Discovers relevant formulas** by matching entity property names against formula inputs
4. **Fills missing formula arguments** from entity property values

```bash
# Before: had to specify domain, formula, and args manually
athena solve "arousal_valence for major_depression"

# After: entity-aware, just name the entity
athena solve "solve major_depression"
# → auto-discovers arousal_valence (properties match formula inputs)
# → auto-fills arousal=0.2, valence=-0.8 from entity properties
# → evaluates to -0.16
```

### Entity-to-Entity Aspect

Entities on different domains have aspect relationships defined by the zodiac wheel.
The aspect represents the nature of the relationship between two entities:

```bash
athena entity-aspect --from schizoaffective_disorder --to lithium
# → Sextile (adjacent, natural flow), confidence 0.85
```

### Current Entities (65 across 12 domains)

| Domain | Entities | Examples |
|--------|----------|---------|
| ♈ Aries (Math & Logic) | 6 | bayesian_inference, signal_detection_theory, falsification |
| ♉ Taurus (Physics & Chem) | 6 | lithium, ssri, antipsychotic, neurotransmitter |
| ♊ Gemini (Astronomy & Comm) | 4 | mercury, cognitive_flexibility, theory_of_mind |
| ♋ Cancer (Earth & Env) | 4 | urban_mental_health, climate_anxiety, environmental_enrichment |
| ♌ Leo (Biology & Med) | 8 | prefrontal_cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, neuroplasticity |
| ♍ Virgo (Economics) | 4 | mental_health_economics, pharmacoeconomics |
| ♎ Libra (Engineering) | 5 | fmri, eeg, digital_phenotyping, computational_psychiatry |
| ♏ Scorpio (CS & AI) | 6 | diagnostic_classifier, graph_neural_network, explainable_AI |
| ♐ Sagittarius (History) | 6 | dsm_history, psychopharmacology_history, freudian_psychoanalysis |
| ♑ Capricorn (Language) | 4 | clinical_interview, diagnostic_formulation |
| ♒ Aquarius (Philosophy) | 4 | mind_body_problem, qualia, medical_ethics |
| ♓ Pisces (Psychology) | 8 | schizoaffective_disorder, major_depression, dopamine |

---

## Token Budget

Athena tracks every LLM token consumed as an **entity** on the wheel. The budget is not an external
counter — it's a query over the entity registry:

```bash
# Show current usage
athena budget
# → Token Budget: 0% used (0/3000 total)

# Reset counters
athena budget-reset
```

Features:
- Every `TokenSpend` is an `Entity` tagged with `token_spend`, domain, purpose, and source
- Hard caps: prompt (2000), completion (1000), total (3000) tokens per session
- `BudgetCheck::Ok/Warning/Blocked` enforcement before LLM calls
- Deterministic fallback on budget exceeded (no silent partial spends)
- Per-domain breakdown of token usage

---

## MCP Server Tools

Athena exposes its capabilities as MCP tools for LLM integration:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `athena_validate` | Validate a claim through math/logic/formal gates |
| `athena_traverse` | Traverse the zodiac wheel from a domain |
| `athena_compose` | Compose formulas into a reasoning chain |
| `athena_formula_search` | Search formulas by keyword |
| `athena_wheel` | Display wheel graph structure |
| `athena_entity_list` | List all entities in the knowledge graph |
| `athena_entity_get` | Get entity details by ID |
| `athena_entity_aspect` | Compute aspect between two entities |
| `athena_entity_search` | Search entities by keyword |
| `athena_budget_stats` | Show token budget usage |

---

## Non-Math Formulas

Athena also supports grammar rules, code patterns, and logical structures as first-class formulas.
These are loaded from `formulas/nonmath/` alongside the mathematical formulas.

```toml
[[logic]]
id = "modus_ponens"
form = "If P then Q. P. Therefore Q."
premises = ["If P then Q", "P"]
conclusion = "Q"
is_valid = true

[[grammar]]
id = "subject_verb_agreement"
pattern = "^(\\w+) (\\w+) the (\\w+)$"
transform = "$1 $2s the $3"
description = "Basic subject-verb agreement"
rule_type = "prescriptive"

[[code]]
id = "early_return"
language = "general"
template = "if (condition) { return value; }"
alternative = "Single exit point pattern"
complexity = 3
is_anti_pattern = false
```
