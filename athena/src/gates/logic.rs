//! # Logic Gate — validates logical form and inference patterns
//!
//! Assimilates the CID fallacy pattern library (69 patterns across 6 categories)
//! from CID's `gates/fallacy.rs`. CID's patterns were derived from a systematic
//! audit of common logical fallacies in LLM reasoning, organized into formal,
//! informal, probabilistic, causal, epistemic, and rhetorical categories.
//!
//! Also includes 12 standard valid inference patterns (modus ponens, syllogism, etc.)
//! for a total of 81 detectable patterns.
//!
//! All patterns are hardcoded as const arrays — no HashMap, no runtime allocation,
//! fully deterministic.
